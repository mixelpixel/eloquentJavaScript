## [Chapter 3](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) - Functions
> *"People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones."*  
-Donald Knuth

01. Defining a Function
	- [03.01a.js](ch03-functions/03.01a.js) - Squaring a number
	- [03.01b.js](ch03-functions/03.01b.js) - Make some noise!
	- [03.01c.js](ch03-functions/03.01c.js) - Raise a base by an exponent

> "Some functions produce a value, such as power and square, and some don’t, such as makeNoise, which produces only a side effect. A return statement determines the value the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function. The return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined."

02. Parameters and Scopes
	- [03.02.js](ch03-functions/03.02.js)
> "The parameters to a function behave like regular variables, but their initial values are given by the caller of the function, not the code in the function itself ... An important property of functions is that the variables created inside of them, including their parameters, are local to the function ... "

03. Nested Scope

> *"On two occasions I have been asked, ‘Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?’ [...] I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."*  
-Charles Babbage, Passages from the Life of a Philosopher (1864)

## [Chapter 5](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html) - Higher Order Functions
> *"Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest programs. ‘Two-hundred thousand lines,’ said Tzu-li, ‘not counting comments!’ Tzu-ssu responded, ‘Pssh, mine is almost a million lines already.’ Master Yuan-Ma said, ‘My best program has five hundred lines.’ Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened."*  
-Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming

> *"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."*  
-C.A.R. Hoare, 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture
